I migrated my personal web-site to Hugo framework from a bootstrap web-site. So I can easily manage blog in a statically generated web-site. \
It has many nice templates which are free for commercial use and made by the community. This makes creating of a website for a purpose very fast.
Creating and editing blog posts as .md (Markdown) files which is useful.

Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website for more details about hugo.
