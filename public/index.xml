      <description>I migrated my personal web-site to Hugo framework from a bootstrap web-site. So I can easily manage blog in a statically generated web-site. It has many nice templates which are free for commercial use and made by the community. This makes creating of a website for a purpose very fast. Creating and editing blog posts as .md (Markdown) files which is useful.
Visit the Hugo website for more details about hugo.</description>
